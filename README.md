We created this YOLOv5 trained model for detecting endangered species of Florida in the wild. Our model was trained on a dataset of close to 800 images including the images of panthers, manatees, sea turtles, key deers and alligators.

The project used YOLOv5 trainer and detector provided by Ultralytics on their github repo 

The model has been trained on 300 epochs and has some impressive accuracy. The pytorch file for the trained weights can be downloaded from here
